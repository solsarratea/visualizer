This repo contains visualizations of different shaders in Three.js. 
It is a still work in progress as I am still learning the technologies used.

It was developed at the Recurse Center.

## Packages used
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for displaying shaders interactively.
* [data.gui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dat.gui) for controlling certain parameters.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for modern JS (ES6) syntax, code modularization, bundling, and serving locally.

## For running locally

Go to the `./build` folder
1. Run `npm install`
3. RUn `npm run build`
2. Run `npm run serve`
